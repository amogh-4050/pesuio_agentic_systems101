An interactive web-based platform that enables users to upload, simulate, and visualize aerodynamic models using Three.js, machine learning, and advanced CFD techniques. Designed for aerospace, automotive, and architectural applications, the tool provides user-friendly visualization of airflow dynamics around 3D models, with options (to be added: for parameter adjustments and immersive AR/VR experiences to enhance comprehension of complex aerodynamic principles). Powered by the MERN stack, this platform integrates MongoDB for data storage, Express.js and Node.js for backend processing, and React with Three.js for real-time 3D rendering.
